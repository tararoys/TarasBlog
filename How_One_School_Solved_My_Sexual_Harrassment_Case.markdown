#How My School Solved My Sexual Harassment Case in Less Than 10 Hours

When I attended Dev Bootcamp Chicago in Spring of 2014, I got sexually harassed.  There are dozens, perhaps hundreds of stories in the news about schools mishandling such cases.  This is not one of those stories.  

This is a story of how one school got it right.  

I e-mailed the complaint Saturday, Feb 15, 2014, at 10:29 AM.  I was shaking, crying, and in a state of shock.  I felt abused and violated.  School was no longer a safe place of techy, nerdy fun, where I could deep-dive into code and lose myself for hours.  It was a dangerous battleground where I had to watch my back from the men, who composed 90% of the school.  The future stared back at me like a loaded gun, and my brain was already cringing away from the questions I knew were going to be asked.  What were you drinking?  Why were you drinking?  What were you wearing?  It was not as though he actually touched you, so why do you feel assaulted?  How can you consider it harassment? 

On Wed, Feb 26, 2014, at 9:52 PM, eleven days later, after 10 hours of back-and-forth, it was over.  That was when I sent a relieved email to my mother saying that my complaint had been resolved to my satisfaction.  My mind was off the assault and back on trying to figure out what the heck a ruby class was.  The memory of the incident seemed no more emotionally charged than the memory of the time I burned my dinner: somewhat unpleasant, but not a persistent trauma.  I could throw myself back into learning.  And boy, did I need to...I was struggling with Dev Bootcamp. I was barely making the grade.  I was terrified that I would not pass the next exam.  But the one thing I was not concerned about was whether Dev Bootcamp had my back if someone attacked me again.  

How did this happen?  How did I go from being terrified of Dev Bootcamp and 90% of my classmates to feeling safe enough to let myself focus on learning to code?

The answer has very little to do with me and everything to do with Dave Hoover.  

Dave Hoover was the leader of Dev Bootcamp that Spring of 2014.  In a very real sense, Dev Bootcamp Chicago was his creation: he founded it, wrote curriculum for it, hired all of its staff, and shaped its culture and institutions.  Before he became a programmer, Dave was a family therapist.  Dave knew that he was going to put his students into a 9-week pressure cooker, and designed Dev Bootcamp with safety mechanisms to prevent his students from breaking under the stress.  

I participated in every one of those safety mechanisms, and can say, without reservations, that they are the only things that kept me sane and mostly stable through Dev Bootcamp. 
 
First, Dave knew that cohorts of students who bond deeply did the best. He engineered situations to create a deep bond.  One of the best ways to create a deep bond is to get people to share their vulnerabilities.  To do that, he created a series of classes called Engineering Empathy.  These classes were designed to make it safe to share fears and insecurities. Students could prove to each other that everyone was human, that everyone had fear, and it was safe to show weakness. Because of that, we felt safe around each other, and could focus on learning.   

Second, Dave brought in a therapist twice a week and allowed students to sign up for free therapy. The therapist was literally brought into the school and given  a specially set-aside room, so that getting therapeutic help was merely a matter of signing up for an appointment and walking ten steps. Dave made it clear that he would tolerate no shaming or stigmatizing of people who went to the therapist. I signed up for a half-hour session every single time the therapist came in. 

Third, Dave himself was all over, everywhere, soft-spoken, willing to offer advice, but most importantly, always willing to listen.  And so, it was against this backdrop, against this system, that I was attacked in his school. 

And when the attack happened, I e-mailed Dave Hoover.  

I seriously considered not telling him.  Despite the fact that he had run a session of Engineering Empathy that explaining that systematic oppression was a very real thing, and that it does, in fact, suck more to be a woman in tech than to be a man, I considered not telling him.  Despite the fact that Dave is well aware of his privilege, and his moral responsibility to do something about the diversity imbalance in tech, I considered not telling him.  Despite the fact that I had been e-mailing him for weeks about how parts of the Dev Bootcamp admissions process were intimidating for me as a woman, and that he had been both listening and and acknowledging that what I was seeing was both real and a real problem, I considered not telling him. 

Why? Because, at the end of the day, he was a financially secure, white, heterosexual, mentally stable, cisgendered man who had successfully founded two companies and was in a position of authority over me, and I was a financially insecure, white, mentally ill, possibly autistic, cisgendered woman who had failed five times to become a computer programmer and had a history of being something of a problem child at DBC.  Every other week, I would have to go to the staff with some new problem, and they would have to make some new accommodation for me: whether it be letting me take the assessment from home because I was too sick to come in, letting me repeat phase 2 an unprecedented third time, letting me set up a small tea shop inside the school for giggles, having someone type for me because I had typed so much I injured my ligaments, letting me politely swear about the DBC admissions process to Dave over e-mail...the staff at DBC were running flat out and were always overworked, and I was told by one of the instructors that they did not have the time or ability to give all of the help I was asking for.  

And then...this.  This would require lots of time and help, and once again, it was me who had the problem.  Would this be the straw that broke the camel's back? 

I wrote the email.  I pressed send.  

Dave got back to me exactly thirty-two minutes later.  

He said he was very glad that I wrote him.  He said he had some questions, but that it was totally ok if I didn't answer them.  It was obvious that he had read every last line of my e-mail. He validated my feelings.  He demanded nothing of me, but did request clarification on a few things.  He agreed to do two of the things I requested immediately. 

Reading his e-mail now, I realize that he never actually said that he believed me, or that he was taking my side in the incident.  But it certainly felt like he was on my side.  Actually, he wasn't on 'my side.'  Instead, he gave me something a lot more important.  He made me feel like he personally, and through him, DBC as a whole, had my back.  

We corresponded for the rest of the weekend, and Dave listened.  After he listened, he did most of what I asked. I asked Dave to have a DBC staff member chat with me for fifteen minutes every morning first thing in the morning for a week.  Dave nominated himself, and for the next five days, for fifteen minutes first thing in the morning, he kept me posted on how DBC was handling my complaint.  He also listened to my concerns and fears.  By the end of the week, I was no longer talking to him about the attack. Instead, I was back to talking about the difficulties of learning to code.  

Dave also handled the man who attacked me. He asked me if I wanted an apology from the man, and I said no.  I believed that if he disrespected me enough to attack me in the first place, forcing him to apologize to me would just make him resent me, piss me off, and serve no useful purpose.  I wanted the guy to learn a lesson from this, but I also knew that for a man in a privileged position to understand, even dimly, the serious damage a sexual attack can do is a years-long process.  It's even harder if a man has actually done a sexual attack, because admitting the damage it causes requires admitting to himself that he is the sort of person that can do that sort of thing.  It's far easier to blame the girl for over-reacting to a 'joke' than to make that sort of fundamental admission.  In short, expecting him to realize why I was so damaged by it would be pointless. 


So, I asked Dave to do an end-run around the problem for me.  I wanted my attacker to know that his behavior was unacceptable in a way that might prevent him from doing the same thing to other women in the future.  I knew that the attacker respected Dave, so I told Dave to make the man apologize to him for disrespecting Dev Bootcamp and acting in an unprofessional manner.  Dave did, and added a few touches of his own: he specifically told the man that he was disappointed that he had created an unsafe space for an existing DBC student.  While this was happening, several male members of my cohort also sent emails to my attacker demanding apologies and expressing disapproval.  The man was told-off by the sort of people he respected: other men.  He apologized to Dave.  He apologized to my cohort.  I never heard a word from him, which is what I wanted.  I didn't have to do a thing.

The most incredible part of this whole story is that, from start to finish, I spent less than 10 hours of my life over two weeks dealing with the attack and its aftermath.  Most of that time was used composing the first report and nerving myself to hit the 'send' button.  Throughout the process, I never had to repeat myself.  I didn't have to advocate.  I didn't have to get a lawyer.  I didn't have to fight. All I had to do was speak up. 

And I was heard.

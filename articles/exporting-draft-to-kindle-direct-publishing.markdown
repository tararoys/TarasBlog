I've been writing books for about seven years now, and writing has gotten a lot easier with practice.  It's now about has hard as lifting weights, or running every day. After writing for a nearly a decade, I decided I wanted to try and make some money. This spring, I got motivated to publish a couple of my books.  

I discovered why there are so few authors. If writing a book is like lifting weights, publishing books is like dressing up in a swimsuit and running through a cactus field.  If you make a wrong move, it is nothing but unending pain. The good news is that if you do everything right, it is possible to get your book published in a single day.  The bad news is that if you run into the slightest problem you need to be a computer programmer to fix the problem.

I happen to be a computer programmer. So far, it has taken me a quarter million dollars in university education, training, computer science bootcamps, and general messing around on a computer in order to become a computer programmer, and I could barely figure out how to do it.  I think that is idiotic that authors need to be computer experts in order to figure out how to get their book published.  I had to set up five different programs, including two command-line programs, in order to convert my book from a markdown file format to a .mobi file format. I told myself that there HAD to be an easier way.

 I was writing my second book, when I discovered, almost by accident, the easier way to do it.

I use a program called Draft to write.  When Draft saves your file, it saves it as a type called Mardown.  The hardest part of publishing a book was converting the Markdown file to a .mobi file.  I figuret out how to do it, and since I don't wnat you to suffer as I suffered, I wrote it down.  In fact, I wrote a whole book about how to write book with draft and publish them on Amazon kindle.  

This blog post is the most important important chapter, because it covers the part that people have the most difficulty with: converting your book to a form that Kindle will accept.   

If you want to see the rest of the book, click on any of the links below.  And if you run into any trouble at all with the chapters, there is a link on the page that says 'Help tlroys edit this book.' Click on it, and write me the question in the part that is giving you trouble.  I'll get an email, and I'll email you back with the answer.

And now, the tutorial:  Exporting Your Book The Easy Way.


Make yourself a  little test book with Draft. If you don't want to write your test book, feel free to [copy mine](https://draftin.com/documents/324416?token=-HlK25CGSD7rC8P3LsnP4kIEyJs14mAU5dzwZ1xoqAOZHqtLnujGc0NkPgfzx8roIPoEWAlR85mbPsnhlPKrVdc). 

Here's what we're going to do. Amazon, and spedifically, Amazon's service Kindle Direcg Publishing, is really touchy about the format of books.  If you don't have your book in exactly the right format, it won't let you upload your book.

There is a way to export a book from Draft to a format that Kindle will accept.  You export it as a Word Document.  When you go to publish your book, there will be a place for you to upload the book file.  The Kindle uploader will take that Word Document and convert it into a fairly nicely-formatted Kindle book. 

I'm now going to rant for the next paragraph: trying to figure out how to export a book from Draft to a format the Kindle importer would accept was a lot like trying to fit two hoses together where one hose is slightly bigger than the other.  Theorectially, Draft can export Kindle .mobi files, a file called a .epub, raw html files, and docx files.  Theoretically, the kindle importer can take in .mobi files, .epub files, raw html files, and .docx word documents. Unfortunately, what Draft exports for .mobi, .epub, and docx files is slightly different than what Kindle can import, so the only easy way to get your document from Draft to Kindle is to export it as a .docx word document. 

There is a hard way to do it that also gives you a lot more control over how to export your book.  In fact, I was going to write a series of 5 blog posts about how to install and set up the 5 different programs you need in order to create your ebook.  Fortunately, I discovered a much, much easier way. 

So let's get to it. 

##Creating a Folder

One of the things the Kindle importer is really touchy about is having a table of contents for your book.  Draft has a hidden feature that generates a table of contents for you. It requires using the folders feature. So the first thing we are going to do is move this document to a folder.

Go to a Draft document.  The document I'm using in this example is my trusty Test Book document. 

In the upper left corner, click on the ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/02_INLINE_Click_On_The_Home_Icon.png)Home icon.

This opens the Draft Home menu. Select ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/04_INLINE_Select_Move.png)Move.

This opens the Move this Document To Another Folder Dialog. 

Click on the new folder  ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/06_INLINE_Click_The_New_Folder_Link.png) link. 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/07_Create_A_Folder_Called_My_Test_Ebook.png)

This opens a new folder form.  Type in a folder.  I named mine 'My Test Ebook." 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/08_INLINE_Select_The_Move_Button.png)

Now, Click the Move button. 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/09_When_You_Look_At_The_Home_Menu_You_Will_See_Folders_My_Test_Ebook.png)

This moved your document into the My Test Ebook folder. You can see this by clicking on the Home Menu and noticing that there is now a thing called My Test Ebook. 


![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/10_INLINE_Click_On_My_Test_Ebook.png)

Click on My Test Ebook.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/11_It_Will_Take_You_To_The_Test_Ebook_Folder.png)

This takes you to the My Test Ebook folder. 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/12_You_Can_Press_The_Export_As_Word_Or_Google_Doc_Button_But_It_Will_Create_A_Nasty_Looking_Table_Of_Contents.png)

On the left, you can see an Export button.  If you press it, it will have an option that says Export as Word or Google Doc. You can export the book right now.  

If you do that, the export will create a nice Word document with a Table of Contents.  You need that Table of Contents for Kindle to accept your book.  

Draft creates a table of contents in one of two ways.  It goes through your file and looks for all lines that begin with a single '#'.  

It assumes those are chapter titles.  It puts those chapter titles in the table of contents and puts the table of contents at the beginning of your Word Document.  

This way works just fine.  A word of caution, though: Use very short chapter titles.  The disadvantage of using this method instead of the hard way is that you are stuck with how the Kindle importer converts your Table of Contents, and long chapter titles end up looking  look terrible in the final conversion.  


##Splitting The Book Into Chapter Files

I, however, like to organize my book a little bit before I export it.  It doesn't really matter for this really short book, but I have noticed if you have a longer document, Draft gets really, really slow.  Folders allow you to organize your book into separate files and still export it as one document.  In fact, it uses the titles of the files to create the table of contents.  So let's set that up. 

In the My Test Ebook folder, press the Edit button ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/13_INLINE_Press_My_Test_Ebooks_Edit_Function.png)for the Test Ebook file. 



![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/14_It_Will_Take_You_Back_To_The_Edit_Page.png)

It will take you back to the Edit Page for your document.

Open the Home menu. and click on ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/17_INLINE_Click_on_My_Test_Ebook.png)the My Test Ebook link.

It will take you back to the folder. 

Click on ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/19_INLINE_Click_On_New_Document.png) New Document.

Press Command-V to paste the chapter you copied. You now have your chapter in a different folder. 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/21_Repeat_The_Process_Once_More_With_The_Other_Chapter_So_You_Have_Your_Three_Chapters_In_Three_Different_Files.png)

Repeat this process once more with the other chapters so you have your three chapters in three different files. 

##Reorder Your Chapters 

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/22_The_Chapters_Will_Be_Out_Of_Order_You_Can_Click_and_hold_anywhere_in_The_White_Space_To_Grab_A_Chapter_And_Drag_It_Into_The_Right_Position.png)

After you are done, you will notice that the chapters are out of order.  Fortunately, Draft is a really neat program.  You can click anywhere in the white part of the space where the document is, hold your mouse button down, and drag the document so that you can put your chapters in the right order. It is important that you do so because Draft will make the Table of Contents based on this order. 

#Naming the Chapters

Draft uses the document name to generate the Table of Contents.  The thing is, it also uses any lines that begin with a single '#' to make the table of contents.  If you have both named your documents and put '#' chapter headings in your document, Draft will assume you wanted both. So either use document names OR use single '#' headings, but DON'T use both.  

I like to use document names, so I'm going to name all of my documents and delete all of the single '#' headings from my documents. 

Here's how to do that.

Select the chapter title and press Command-X. This will both copy the title and delete it at the same time.

#Check If The Document Is Valid

The very next thing we want to do is make sure that we can convert this Docx document into a Kindle ebook.

For right now, you want to ignore most of this page. Scroll down until you get to step number 5.  This is the place where we upload our book and have it converted to a Kindle. If it passes this test, we can fill out the rest of the form.  If it doesn't, there is no point in filling out the rest of the form until it is somehow fixed.

At the end, you want to see a green box that says "Upload And Conversion was Successful."  This means that Amazon was able to turn your document into a kindle book. 

## Previewing the book

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/49_Now_You_Want_To_Preview_Your_Book.png)

Now you want to go to section 6 and preview your book. Press the ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/50_Press_Preview_Book.png) Preview button.

Whoopse!  After previewing my book, it looks like I made my chapter title way too long.  It looks terrible.  So I'm going to go back and change chapter two do something short and sweet, and repeat the whole process again.  Sigh. 


![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/295750082/How_To_Publish_A_Book_With_Kindle/01_Writing_Your_Book/05_Converting_To_Kindle_The_Easy_Way/52_Change_The_Title_reexporting_everything_and_reloading_it_and_previewing_it_Allows_Me_To_Have_A_Nicer_Looking_Table_Of_Contents.png)

After changing the chapter title, I go through the whole process again.  The shorter chapter gives me a nicer table of contents.  

I do this a lot when I am making my book, because the amazon preview lets me see if my book actually looks all right on a Kindle. I highly recommend clicking through your entire book (or having someone do so) to help you catch formatting errors or things that just don't look right. 

And we have successfully exported our book and uploaded it to Kindle!

Today I got to see a slice of a fish hatchery owner's life.  

For thirty years, [Jim Frey Fish Hatchery](http://www.jimfreyfishhatchery.com/index.html) have raised bluegill, bass, and grass carp in the pond at the Roys family farm.  Every year, Jim and his crew come to to the pond and catch a bunch of fish to use as stock for other ponds.

How do they do it? Today I got to see how you go about catching a lot of fish at once.

##To Catch A Fish

To catch a bunch of fish in a pond, you (and half a dozen of your friends and family) use a seine net.  A seine net is sort of like a moveable wall that you can use to herd fish into a small enough area that you can catch them with a dip net. (A dip net is like a big version of those little green aquarium nets you see in fish stores.)

Here's what I saw.  

First, they pulled on some hip-waders.

Next, they cut the pond in half with a net.

Then, they left one end in place and started pulling the other end of the net along the bank.  The idea is to heard the fish into a smaller and smaller area. 
They started pulling the net onto the shore.

As one of them said, the idea is to "Go slow.  We're watching for fish."  Sadly, they did not catch any big fish on that half of the pond. That meant it was time to pull out the small fry net!  A small fry net has smaller holes so you can catch fish that are only about an inch long. 

Again, it was time to divide the pond in half.

Then, they pulled the net in.

When you pull the net too hard, sometimes the floats go under the water and the fish can escape over the top.  It helps to have someone in a boat hold the top of the net up.

They caught a bunch of tadpoles!  Sadly, tadpoles aren't worth anything. Fortunately, they caught a bunch of bluegill with the tadpoles.  There were about 10 tadpoles for every bluegill. 

Now for the slimy part: sorting the fish from the tadpoles.

The small fry net was pulled close into the bank of the pond, making a small pocket that was full of fish and tadpoles.  Using a dipping net, they dipped into the pocket, catching about a hundred tadpoles at a time. 

Hidden within those hundred tadpoles are the bluegills.  They poured the catch onto the bank, and tadpoles and bluegills started flopping everywhre.  People croweded around, caught the bluegills, and put them in buckets.  The bluegills are very easy to spot: they flashed and glittered like pale sapphires in the sunlight. 

It's important to have wet hands when you're sorting fish this way, because  dry hands kill small fry.

They repeated the process with the other half of the pond.  

This time, they caught some grass carp: some three foot long grass carp. It was so long that the tail stuck out of the bucket. 

You have to stick grass carp head first into a bucket of water so they can't get out while you carry it to a bigger holding tank.

Once you get in, you have to be careful with grass carp, because they like jumping out of their holding tanks.

Five hours later, they had seined the pond five times. They'd caught about 10 large gras carp, three bass, and several hundred tiny, one-inch bluegill.  

After seining the pond and sorting fish five times, it's time to pack up.

"Now what you just saw," Jim told me, "Was only half the job.  Once we get home, we need to lay out the nets to dry, put the fish away, grade the fish, and get rid of all the tadpoles, and clean up all the equipment."

I asked him how you would get rid of tadpoles if they're all swimming around in the same bucket with the fish.  At the pond, they had been dumping nets onto the grassy bank and soritng them by hand, but at the hatchery they have a better way.  They use a fish grader.  A fish grader at base, a piece of metal with holes in it.  You can get all the one-inch fish by making them swim through a one-inch hole.  The ones that don't fit get stuck, and you can separate them out.  Tadpoles about one inch tall, but they're also a lot wider then bluegill, so if you make a one inch slot that is also skinny, you can sort bluegill from tadpoles.  

All in all, it was a fascinating look at at what actually goes on inside the Roys family pond.

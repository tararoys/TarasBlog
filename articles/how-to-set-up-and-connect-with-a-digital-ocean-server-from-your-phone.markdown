What if you have nothing but an iphone?  Can you be a programmer?  Specifically, can you set up a Digital Ocean Server?  Yes you can!

First, we need to set up a server using the Digital Ocean webpage.  Then, we need to download an application called Server Auditor that lets us connect to our server from our phone. After that, we can log in to our server from our smart phone and program all day long.

#Setting Up Your Digital Ocean Server
 
 Go to www.digitalocean.com
![Digital Ocean Login.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17642?token=8dIAo0ydi_TqJrNNmqHvAE2G00xdh0gO70-i_jihI4CAFd7zqv65kWHc0tbJDi1bY7BhWIXlRD4wQaWrB-7D6w8) 

In the center of the page, you will see a place to put in your username and password.  This will create a Digital Ocean account. Go ahead and choose a your email and a password and press Create Account.

You will see a "Welcome to Digital Ocean" screen with three icons that walk you through setting up your Digital Ocean server.

![Welcome To Digital Ocean Screen.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17643?token=jJtRf6_YOtloe1w3dJCpLSAprtF3LR8xAPD8uJ4Gb8BeRH2ppoMAPMfFsA5JSsGp8nY7fFDXpnCQHvzKqTfaS98) 

The first thing to do is confirm your email.  Go to your email account.  You will see an email from Digital Ocean. 

![Digital Ocean Confermation Email.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17644?token=RZ_LNswz9h8zJx7NS-gBTZZNWqGQGpu2_he3gXNskw_pY--GUBC9-DQq7mTIJBH5qr-Llq7UBCbwaIN3VmQJXDA) 

It will have a confirmation link.  Click on that to confirm your email. You will be taken back to the Digital Ocean Welcome Page, and you will be on the next step. 

![Adding A Payment Method.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17646?token=-AupGoaAb0g2aRBOGY9w889c_OGwLGDOQvZKp99pySmMID0ZKlTIxv12zZ57Wv3mSKz3kraS9pFRkMWnkTKQ4oQ) 

The next step is to enter a payment method. The minimum payment is $5 per month to get a basic server.

 You can either add a credit card or pay with Paypal.

![Set Payment Method.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17647?token=_T-7611krXcoAPb99q5_TJBJttwDlbxthjL4FoI3ABQGS58BE0GLv1fHP_tIxFcW7iOVluKTciw-N2nyqFeQuh4) 

After putting in a payment method, we can make a server! You will be taken to the next step. 

![Make A Server](https://draftin.com:443/images/17711?token=zBNFDlwerxGrIIlGoyS05l_9fqS_opbs7LQO1-Uc4fSg6O9uuN0EY0qAefo2nLjP7xRUVYxtxpnMQRDbKOtqQ0o) 


The only thing you need to do on this page is give your server a name.  Digital Ocean has sensible defaults for everything else.  I named my server "Test."  After choosing a name for your server, scroll to the bottom and press create.

![creating a droplet.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17712?token=2JB15tfMG0u758gYlBMjWDpwsgkxS_kVSdxZn0RpwQyh56_LBRw2kN2dD87uI83uuFYwGBYu3kuwZcnZBaeulEI) 

You will see a screen that says "We are now creating your Droplet."  It will take about a minute, and then you will see your brand new server appear on the screen.

At this point, we are done with the access panel.  In fact, you may never have to look at the access panel again! We can access our server by logging into it directly with the username, IP address, and password Digital Ocean has emailed to you. 

##How To Log Into Your Server From Your Iphone

Now we need to download an app called Server Auditor.  Server Auditor lets you log into a server from your iPhone using a secure connection called an SSH connection.

![Server Auditor In The App Store.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17714?token=xwXPetvTJFM5nnvP8U4Y9sqygWuEoTXTx8X-DaTKtk16SCW-yZLls_yc9dBuixYeZQJNoaVK4zn2IdLBVMbvZxM) 

Once Server Auditor is downloaded, open it.  You will see a somewhat mysterious blank screen that looks like this: 

![Server Auditor With No Connections.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17747?token=X0Hl6-4zzqmPIRC22bWFijXXEbAkiSQcn5lyn0JM14tqpWhe_TioQoc6AuHwxuhHsvx5BBlfHeSSJ8dG2l-j3Tc) 

In the upper right-hand corner is a little box with an arrow coming out of it.  That is the connection button.  Press it.

A new connection dialog will show up. 
![the new connection dialog will show up.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17756?token=rjrCoF23hLVPqdf82-ZAV_mg9ZPx2mMhjBcuD-jyl8mIlMAHf3fREz0HFY26Ip1Va9nDq0xbc8d-IpRLUNs-4e4) 

Press the new connection button. You will see the new connection form.

![New Connection Form.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17878?token=yJZD-P_pIMVcSB3kagcuZTXaY2WidCzWMe51bx0guqh1EMDd3bWypxOxVa8rZw0URaTtYE2pFYkfw2JPS452LU8) 

At this point, we can log in to our server.  When you created your server, Digital Ocean sent you an email.  That email contains three things: a username, a password, and the IP address of your server.  The email looks like this:

![Digital Ocean Email.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17776?token=dSFHcGUMRqgzosAb1dzIMQG7-vb7vwSYpwZuKfCfkDHo4ZVOKAvB9Z_qM8bN_0FqL0vDO7pP80xvEgIBBQI9eZI) 

Enter the details of the email into the connection form.  For example, in the space marked root, I put root.  (Root is the default name of the user who has full control over the server.  When Digital Ocean sent you the email, it sent you the password for this 'root' user.)

In the space marked example.hostname.com, put the IP address.  You will find the IP address in the email Digital Ocean sent you. 

An IP address is like the address of a house.  It is a number that tells the whole internet where to find your server.  If you have never seen an IP address before, it is because normally you use website names to talk about servers instead of numbers. 

If you have a website, you give it a name like www.alfred.com.  If Alfred were your friend and he had an apartment, you would say "I'm going to Alfred's house" instead of "I'm going to 22 West Lake St, Normal, IL, 60178". For that same reason, you would say "I'm going to www.alfred.com" instead of 188.34.578.900.
 
Teaching how to link the IP address to a url like www.alfred.com is beyond the scope of this tutorial.  So, for now, we can use the raw IP address.  This is why we are putting the IP address in the form marked example.hostname.com.

Finally, in the space marked password, enter the password found in the email. 


![Fill out connection form.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17799?token=szbFO2-wh0NNkS6Gl0V-PN0Xqr0cKLV-v0z7NKUAJYI28vpa4nfQwocYeGOix4Pw_-_LqW_2MVGtxGJqcTjUqTo) 

Press connect.

A screen will pop up, saying "The authenticity of this host cannot be established."  This is basically the computer telling you, "I don't know this other computer, and I can't tell if talking to this computer is a good idea."  Since you just set up the server and paid for it, you know that you want to connect. Therefore, press the 'continue' button. 

![the authenticity of this host cannot be established.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17800?token=pUeLdRxvN95OLzbBhaWPrFepGS_ORm-fIvSpS1Nm0JrsolMN8s3GJ9XcgICJZeLGhM78OS8T3RR7hGq33gtuPss) 

Since you are making a connection with Server Auditor for the first time, you will be shown a walkthrough for how to use Server Auditor.

![Server Auditor Walkthrough.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17802?token=Ln1hVwDoBIEtzP7_Q54Z7i1-x9fXaz7JAg_cChrHy0RMoDPyM7sXEfUMbyo44wHgZGTrpjCif0Y1NPoBfjzBiqs) 

After going through the walkthrough, it will take you to the command line for your Digital Ocean server.  You are now connected!

![you are now connected.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17801?token=TRaFZva0UqTez9kYTNeUqM6dZzYsfg5-l3ChU-EzH2RLPdGrG4olRdbGmAJlNT9Cdb36Ku2MU0yLX0SM4b_vDfQ) 

##How to Reconnect When Your Connection Drops

If you are logging in to your server with an iPhone, you may not be in a cell network with a good connection. This means you will get disconnected a lot.  

Sadly, Server Auditor will not tell you when you have disconnected. Instead, it will just freeze.  To reconnect, do the following:  

Across the top of the keyboard are a bunch of buttons.  On the left is a button called hide.  Press it. If you see a home button instead, press the 'more' button and the hide button will appear. 

![Press the hide button.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17803?token=lJUJd3FHawvgKBQ8DgbFlL656y7n-pB3z2av78x6rQlVT8dbc3iic6QmiH2uNa0Z2rkzkGMoVzHHC0st5VoCpVw) 

It will take you to a screen with a list of all the connections you've made recently.

![Activities Page of Server Auditor.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17869?token=UyAk3yj7s9dVX3WiP54weQdWtGPZFrwh11oSpBRsxlTYXDwLIVvTLChIAnY_GLhmUCCLzjrE4vcoC-sTlwhsV5Q) 

If you are doing this for the first time, you won't see any connctions.  In this example, one connection has been made before. On the right you can see a little number in parenthesis.  That is the number of times you have connected with the server.

Press the server name.  This example server is named root@107.170.84.74. Pressing it starts the connection process.

![making_a_connection.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17872?token=c24Vk5K71I_ut_HfoofrvruDjAcKnVW1ZYaY5u772e__2gkbjQO032JmkSefWTCAMhTHWiox9Z3q_-y1T0TDRLw) 


It will take a few seconds, but you will soon be connected with your server.  Sadly, you will not be where you left off: instead, you will be back in the root directory. If this were a video game, losing a connection and reconnecting is like getting killed and having to start the level over from the beginning.

![You Are Reconnected With Your Server.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/17874?token=4Q7W9srx9e_NHDCp-PKgDaZcX24Dp11qagEWAubvRBOcy_GU0V4i7_tFONLBG5pNwKONI6zIhzRE2EUPjS5ULqw) 

Congrats!  You can now set up, run, and manage a server entirely from your phone!
